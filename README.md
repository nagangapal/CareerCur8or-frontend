# CareerCur8or — Frontend Showcase

This folder is a sanitized frontend showcase copy of the CareerCur8or application.

Purpose
- Provide a readable, self-contained snapshot of the React + TypeScript UI.
- This is not intended to be a runnable or deployed application by itself — API endpoints and secrets have been neutralized.

What was removed or sanitized
- Assistant/chatbot prompt text and any embedded developer prompts were replaced with neutral placeholders.
- Localhost API fallbacks were changed to neutral placeholders (https://example.com) to avoid implying runnable services.
- Old/backup CSS files were removed and canonical styles consolidated under `./styles/`.

If you want to run the UI locally
- Restore appropriate environment variables (Vite .env) for API endpoints (VITE_API_URL, VITE_AUTH_URL, VITE_PARSER_URL, VITE_CHATBOT_URL).
- Install dependencies and run the Vite dev server from the main project or from this folder after adding a full `package.json` and dependencies.

Notes
- This showcase is intended for inspection, demos, and UI reviews. It intentionally omits backend credentials and hard-coded endpoints.
- If you want, I can add a short CONTRIBUTING or RUNNING section with commands to make this a runnable sample.

Generated and sanitized by an automated code clean-up session.
