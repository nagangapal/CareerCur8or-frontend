# CareerCur8or — Frontend Showcase

Welcome! This folder contains the frontend (React + TypeScript) UI for CareerCur8or. It's a sanitized snapshot intended for review and UI inspection.

Quick notes
- This is a showcase copy — not a full runnable app. Backend endpoints, secrets, and assistant prompts have been neutralized or removed.
- Canonical CSS files were consolidated under `./styles/` for easier review.

Screenshots
- I'll add screenshots of the main screens shortly and update this README when they're available.

Want to run it locally?
- Restore appropriate environment variables (Vite .env) for API endpoints: VITE_API_URL, VITE_AUTH_URL, VITE_PARSER_URL, VITE_CHATBOT_URL.
- Add a `package.json` and install dependencies in this folder (if you want a self-contained runnable copy), then run the Vite dev server.

Feedback or next steps
- If you'd like, I can: add runnable instructions, include mocked API endpoints for local demo, or add the promised screenshots.

Generated and sanitized during a repo cleanup session.
